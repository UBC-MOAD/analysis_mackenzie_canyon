The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are used analyze the model results of the Mackenzie Canyon configuration. Its sister repo, mackenzie_canyon, contains more notebooks focused on the model development and improvement.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via

Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

    August: Animations of U, V and W velocity profiles at shelf break depth using pcolormesh.  

* ##[horizontal_velocity_snapshots.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/CanyonsUBC/analysis_mackenzie_canyon/raw/tip/notebooks/general_circulation/horizontal_velocity_snapshots.ipynb)  
    
    Snapshots of daily averages (between day 1 and day 15) of U and V velocities. Plots can be set for different depths. To be used in conjunction with animations_horizontal_velocities.ipynb  

* ##[incoming_velocity_shelf.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/CanyonsUBC/analysis_mackenzie_canyon/raw/tip/notebooks/general_circulation/incoming_velocity_shelf.ipynb)  
    
    Analysis of the incoming velocity over the shelf on the upstream side of the canyon, identifying the time-dependent and advection driven stages.  

* ##[animations_W_top_profiles.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/CanyonsUBC/analysis_mackenzie_canyon/raw/tip/notebooks/general_circulation/animations_W_top_profiles.ipynb)  
    
    August: Animations of the vertical velocity (W) profiles at different depths using pcolormesh and contour lines.  

* ##[animations_velocities_depths.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/CanyonsUBC/analysis_mackenzie_canyon/raw/tip/notebooks/general_circulation/animations_velocities_depths.ipynb)  
    
    Animations of daily averages U and V velocities. Each animation has subplots representing various depths.

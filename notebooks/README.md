The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are used analyze the model results of the Mackenzie Canyon configuration. Its sister repo, mackenzie_canyon, contains more notebooks focused on the model development and improvement.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).
